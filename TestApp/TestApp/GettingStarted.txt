Welcome to Xamarin.Forms! Here are some tips to get started building your app.

Building Your App UI
--------------------

XAML Hot Reload quickly applies UI changes as you make them to your running app.
This is the most productive way to preview and iteratively create your UI.

Try it out:

1. Run the app by clicking the Start Debugging (play) button in the above toolbar. 
2. Open <MainProject>\Views\AboutPage.xaml.
   Don't stop the app - keep it running while making changes.
3. Change something! Hint: change the Accent color on line 14 from "#96d1ff" to "Pink".
4. Watch the About screen update on the device or emulator, with the logo background now pink.

Keep going and try more changes!

Your App Shell
--------------

This template uses Shell, an app container that reduces the complexity of your apps by providing fundamental features including:

- A single place to describe the app's visual hierarchy.
- Common navigation such as a flyout menu and tabs.
- A URI-based navigation scheme that permits navigation to any page in the application.
- An integrated search handler.

Open AppShell.xaml to begin exploring. To learn more about Shell visit: https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/shell/introduction

VIDEO TIPS:


DEBUGGING

	(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvp7wvbyceo)
	ANDROID:
To debug, emulator allows real time modification of the app via the XAML files, allowing you to see changes in real time. 
		This is CRUCIAL, b/c it allows you to see how the code impacts your app IN REAL TIME
		For android, CLICK STOP DEBUGGING at top of VS instead of closing the emulator

	IOS:
Have to have iTunes installed and make sure you right click on iOS and set as default (or choose it at the top )
To debug, simple plug in device and click on 'iPhone' device and click Play
	if you dont see iPhone make sure Hot start is enabled and iTunes is downloaded
	If this done correctly you can setup Hot Restart
		have to login to Apple account
		Also need apple developer account also setup (search this)
